This is a quick and dirty script I pieced to together with @TiredBob. It is a locally hosted page allowing remote control of my GE Storesafe II Pro remotely via serial port. The index.php uses Iframes to display the image from "Motion" running on a Raspberry PI and a Analogue capture card. The Camera.php is the script to inject the HEX along the serial conneciton from the PI to the DVR.
